 * normal comment -> mention -> task trigger takes over. That is why the run
 * response is a `Comment` with `trigger_outcomes` rather than a bespoke shape.

 * - `private` — meant for its creator only; any target is allowed, and the
 *   list endpoint returns it to nobody else.
 *
 * This is intent, NOT an authorization decision — the run endpoint always
 * re-checks invoke permission. Server-driven enum: switch with a `default`.
